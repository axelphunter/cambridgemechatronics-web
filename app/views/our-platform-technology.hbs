    <p class="wow fadeInUp">
      Through the exploration of innovative materials, Cambridge Mechatronics is delivering change amongst a diverse set of high value technology applications. There are a number of technology applications that are set to grow over the coming years with goals to integrate them into a number of industries such as agriculture and medicine affecting the way we live and work.

    <p class="wow fadeInUp">
      There are specific challenges to overcome to make the products faster, smaller and more powerful. CML’s platform technology is well suited to tackle those challenges. Our technology is compact, lightweight, robust and powerful presenting opportunities in a number of high value technology applications. Some examples:

        <h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Drones</h3>
        <p class="wow fadeInUp">
          Most commonly, companies leverage the use of drones to capture high quality imagery however the uses are broadening. New ideas are emerging, such as Amazon’s ambition to launch its drone delivery program using
a fleet of drones to deliver online purchases straight
to customers’ doors. Other applications include agriculture, surveying land, monitoring infrastructure and even emergency response. Drones will require more cameras and sensors to perform advanced
tasks without compromising weight and flight times. Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators are inherently lightweight and compact to accommodate more cameras without sacrificing size and weight. Ensuring a lightweight structure ultimately helps conserve battery life, meaning longer flight times. Its robust structure means it is more resilient to vibrations and precision control data maintains stability even with significant external disturbance.

          Robots are set to be commonplace in assembly facilities, factories, hospitals and the home, as they continue to become more sophisticated and specialised. One of the key themes for next generation robotics is to enable them to conduct very precise procedures, mimicking or even outdoing what humans could achieve. CML’s Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators are highly accurate and compact. SMA wire has great potential in robotics given that its structure has the ability to contract and expand in the same way human muscle can. Another key feature is that CML SMA is audibly silent creating robots that can perform in silent operation.

        <p class="wow fadeInUp">
          The adoption of haptic feedback is forecast to grow dramatically as users demand the next dimension of interactivity with their products beyond sight and sound. By incorporating a sense of touch and tactility, using haptic technology we give us the ability to connect more naturally to our devices. Haptic actuators will need to be small to work within items like wearable tech and to prevent devices getting larger. Despite the size, it still needs to be able to deliver a significant force to provide the engaging experience. Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) has a high force to size ratio with an added benefit of emitting no disruptive electromagnetic fields that prevent other device components from functioning properly. CML’s technology is small and robust enough to function in these applications to help deliver user interactions that are more realistic, useful or simply enjoyable.
